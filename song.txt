Look at you , just look at you now
You're so embarrassin'
Co cry when no one's warchin'
I can't imagine it
How does it feel to be forgotten, forgotten ?
How does it feel ? I hope One day you heal 
How does it feel ? I hope One day you heal 


I know it must be diffucult
I know it isn't what you thought, no
'Cause you walked in, big-ass grin
Talkin' like we're friends, honey , what were you thinkin'?
